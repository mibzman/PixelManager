# Pixel Person Generator
A tool that generates pixel people

## CAUTION- running main.go without modification will generate approx 14k people

This tool defines a grid of pixels, and specefies which pixels on this grid are which body parts:

- Name
- SkinColor
- HairColor
- HairLength
- BeardColor
- HasBeard
  - Sets beard color to skin color if true
- EyeColor

These settings can be used to generate a sprite.  For loops and arrays can be used to generate many combinations with minor variations.

A project demonstrating this can be found at https://mibzman.github.io/CryptoProfs/
